## Time
Time in the dungeon is tracked using turns, which are about 10 minutes long. 
If an action is done that would take more than a few seconds to perform, than it takes the entire turn to accomplish.

Turns are used to track time until a spell ends or torches or lanterns burn out.

As time passes, there is also a chance that you will, for better or worse, cross paths with the dangerous denizens of the dungeons.

## Inventory
Slot-based inventory system: you have 2 body slots and 2 hand slots. If wearing a backpack, it provide 6+Str bonus slots. 
This is the maximum amount of items you may carry.
- Most items take up 1 inventory slot.  
- Bulky items need 2 slots and may need an explanation for how they are transported.  
- Small items (rations, oil flasks, etc.) can be bundled together in packs of 5. Different items cannot be bundled together.
- Insignificantly small items, like coins, don't take up any slots unless gathered in large amounts, 1 slot for every 200.  
- A quiver takes up 1 body slot and can hold 20 arrows for quick access.

During split-second moments, like combat, pulling an item out of your backpack takes time but items in your hand & body slots are always accessible.  
Pulling an item out of your backpack takes a number of rounds equal to its slot size & uses up your action for that round. 
However, each round, you may roll a d6 and, if the roll is equal to or below the slot number, pull out the item immediately without using up an action.  


In incidents that might damage your items like a fall or a fire, roll a d6 and the item at the rolled slot will become damaged, if appropriate.

## Hazards
Many dangers are fairly unique, but the following are common enough to need a consistent ruling.

**Drowning:** If you are drowning, you have 1d6 rounds of air left in your lungs. When you run out of air, you start taking 1d6 damage/round until you can breathe again. 
You can hold your breath for 5+Con bonus rounds. 

**Falling:** Fall damage increases incrementally every 10' past the 1st 10' starting at 1d6. 
| 20' | 30'     | 40'         | ... |
| --- | ------- | ----------- | --- |
| 1d6 | 1d6+2d6 | 1d6+2d6+3d6 | ... | 

You can attempt to absorb 10â€™ using a climbing check. (See Skills)

**Fire:** Someone set on fire by burning oil or similar takes 1d4 damage per round. If a die comes up a 4, an extra 1d4 is added as the fire gets bigger. If a die comes up a 1, a d4 is taken away as the fire starts to go out.  
Water puts out fire and rolling on the ground removes a d4 per round.

**Poison:** Save vs Death or die!
