## Combat
**Declarations**: Each side declares what they intend to do this round of combat before initiative is rolled. 
Spellcasting, praying & movements into/out of melee cannot be changed after initiative is rolled.

**Initiative**: Each side rolls a d6, highest goes first. PC’s win ties. Initiative is rerolled every round.

**Actions**: Each round you can move and do something. Doing something is called an Action.

**Attacking**: Roll a d20, add your attack bonus and the target’s AC. If the result is 20 or more, it’s a hit.  
Melee attack bonus is affected by your strength mod. Ranged attack bonus is affected by your dex mod.  
Roll damage based on weapon. Pretty standard.

**Crits and fumbles**: A natural 20 is a critical hit and a natural 1 is a fumble.

**Surprise**: If your attack surprises an enemy, you get a +4 to-hit bonus.

## Fancy Combat Options
**Gambits**: If you want to do something extra fancy make two attack rolls.
- If both hit, the thing happens! 
- If one hits and one misses, it’s a partial success or success at a cost. 
- If both miss there is some sort of ironic reversal, like you tried to trip them and got tripped up instead.

**Backstab**: When you hit a Surprised opponent with an attack, roll Backstab. On a success, damage is multiplied by the rolled value.
An enemy is Surprised if it was not aware of you before you attacked.

**Opportunity Attacks**: If an opponent moves out of your melee range, you can make a free melee attack against them. On a hit, deal damage and stop them from moving.

**Evade**: Use an action when in melee range of an enemy to meld into the chaos of combat. 
Roll Stealth, on success you gain a +4 melee attack bonus and they cannot target you on their next turn.  
Randomly targeted or Area of Effect attacks might still get you though, so watch out!

**Parry**: Use an action to defend yourself against enemy attacks. Gain -4 AC and immunity to Opportunity Attacks until your next turn.

**Aim**: Use an action to take careful aim. +4 attack bonus with a ranged weapon next round but counts as Surprised this round.

**Shooting into Melee**: Roll to hit against a random combatant. If you aimed last round, you roll vs your intended target.
