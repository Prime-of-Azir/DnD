## When skills are used
Remember, adventurers are competent. But skills are bullshit.
- Anyone can climb with climbing gear but not everyone can climb while being shot at.
- Anyone can pick a shitty lock but not everyone can pick a good one.
- Everyone can hide in a closet but not everyone can hide by standing perfectly still in the dark corner of a room.

Skill rolls are for when you need to do something beyond the capabilities of a competent person.

## Basic system
Everyone has a base 1-in-6 chance of succeeding on a skill boosted further by skill points. Skills are what sets specialists apart!  
Skill checks are done by rolling a d6. You succeed if you roll at or below your skill rank. The Maximum skill rank is 6. 
At skill rank 6, whenever a 6 is rolled, you reroll and only fail if the 2nd roll is also a 6.
- This provides a small but non-zero chance for failure.

In most cases, skills are rolled individually. 
However, if something is done as a group, a group check is done where a single player rolls and the result is compared to everyone's skill rank. 

## The skills
**Climbing:** Roll when climbing at speed, without equipment, or otherwise under pressure. 

**Tinkering:** Pick locks and disarm traps. Lockpicking requires thieves’ tools.
For disarming traps, if you describe how you correctly disarm the trap, no roll is required.

**Awareness:** A last second reflex save against a dangerous effect. On success, you get a single Action to use before the bad thing happens. 
Dive away from the explosion, tackle a friend out of the trap’s path, get your shield out before the monster pounces, that sort of thing.

**Stealth:** Hiding in shadows, evading notice, moving silently, general sneakiness.

**Backstab:** Grants critical hits against Surprised or Flanked enemies.

**Sleight of hand:** Palm objects, pick pockets, and other tasks requiring quick fingers and misdirection.

**First Aid:** Requires a First Aid Kit. Used to remove death tokens equal to number rolled if successful. Failing on a roll of 6 means patient receives 1 hp of damage.

**Bushcraft:** Specifically for hunting, natural healing, constructing shelters in the wilderness, forecasting weather, and not getting lost.
