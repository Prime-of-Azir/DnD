**Hit points**: HP is more like Not Getting Hit Points, a shield of luck and skill between you and physical harm. You don’t die when you run out, you just start getting hit and hurt for real.

**Core**: Real damage is represented by Death Tokens. As you get more hurt, you get more Death Tokens. More Death Tokens mean you roll higher on the Death Tables. 
Rolling higher on the Death Tables gives you more Death Tokens, and so on until you get to the high-end results with all the broken bones and severed limbs and crushed skulls.

**Danger Zone**: When damage would take you into negative HP instead:
- Gain 1 death Token
- Roll 1d6 per Death Token you’ve accrued (including the one you just got).
- Add the amount of excess damage to the result.
- GM looks up the result on the relevant Death Table.

**Medic!**: Along with first aid, anything that heals HP can heal Death Tokens. Remove 1 Death Token for each point of HP healed, with any excess adding onto the patient’s HP as normal.

## What to do when somebody dies
If you die or are too messed up to adventure for a while you have several options.
- **The new guy**: You can roll up a new character at level 1 and get hand-waved back into the game asap.
- **The henchman**: Occasionally picked up in adventures, Henchmen are classed characters who earn a half share of the group’s XP. They make good backup characters.
