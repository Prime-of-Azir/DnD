**Lay on Hands:** You have the power to heal the body and fortify the spirit. At dawn each day, roll 1d6 per level and add your Wisdom modifier. This is your Healing Pool.  
As an action, draw points from the pool to restore as HP to a touched creature. 

**Faith:** At dawn each day, roll 2d6 + level and add your Wisdom modifier.  
This is your Faith total. It's used to perform an act of Miracle.

**Miracles:** Your religion has 3 unique Miracles.  
Calling forth a Miracle is a standard Action and cannot be interrupted.  
After you call forth a miracle, roll 2d6 and attempt to roll equal to or under your Faith total.
- Success: Your Faith total is set to the result of the roll or your level, whichever is higher.
- Failure: Your Faith total drops to zero, and you lose access to Miracles until dawn.

**Observances:** Your religion has unique Observances, acts that will cause you to gain or lose Faith.  
Each Observance can affect your Faith pool once between acts of Miracle & sleep.

**Miracles**
-   **Bless:** Grants a creature 1 reroll on a die roll for 1 turn per level.
-   **Smite:** Make a normal attack roll. On hit, weapon damage bypasses immunities and resistances.  
If the target is inherently Chaotic - like Undead, Demons or fey - you may also drain points from your Healing Pool to deal as bonus damage to the target.
-   **Augury:** Commune with an angel of THE AUTHORITY. They will answer one question per level by imparting a sense of woe or weal.
