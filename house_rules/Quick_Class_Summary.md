- Lay on Hands: All Clerics have the power to heal the body and fortify the spirit. At dawn, they roll 1d6 per level and add their Wisdom mod. This is their Healing Pool. As an action, a Cleric can draw points from the pool to restore that much HP to a touched creature.
- Faith: Clerics have the power to call forth Miracles. At dawn, they roll 2d6+level+Wisdom Modifier. This is their Faith total which, with their wooden holy symbol, can be used to perform a miracle.
- Miracles: Calling forth a Miracle is a normal Action that is performed instantaneously. Afterwards, they roll 2d6, attempting to roll equal to or less than their current Faith total.
	- Success: The Cleric’s Faith total is set to the result of the roll or their level, whichever is higher.
	- Failure: The Cleric’s Faith total drops to zero, and they lose access to Miracles until next dawn.
- Observances: Clerics gain or lose Faith by following acts called Observances. Observances can only affect their Faith. After they call forth a Miracle, Observances can affect them again.

### The church: Worshippers of THE AUTHORITY
Theme: Dominant faith of the realm

Powers: Standard Cleric stuff. Fight Chaos, praise THE AUTHORITY.

Miracles:
- Bless: Grant a creature a reroll on a die roll.
- Smite: Make a normal attack roll. On hit, deal normal weapon damage which bypasses immunities and resistances. If the target is inherently Chaotic - like Undead, Demons or Elves - you may also drain points from your Healing Pool to deal as much bonus damage to the creature.
- Augury: Commune with an angel of THE AUTHORITY.  They will answer one question per level by imparting a sense of woe or weal.
