## Weapon Size
Melee weapons have 4 size categories. These weapon categories affect the damage die used for the weapon.
| Small | Medium | Great |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 1d6   | 1d6/8    | 1d10  |

- Great: These weapons must be wielded with two hands. Two-handed swords, mauls, great axes. 
- Medium: These can be wielded one- or two-handed. Standard swords, battle axes, and maces along with long weapons like spears and halberds.
- Small: These are one-handed weapons, including short swords and hand axes. 

Great weapons and long weapons are considered bulky.
Small weapons are not affected by Str mod.
## Melee Weapon Bonus
Melee weapons come in a variety of delicious flavours. The equipment list has various generic “weapon” categories. When you buy one you also get to choose which type of weapon it is.

- Choppy: Axes. Against Light armour or less, increase damage die by one size.
- Smashy: Hammers. +2 to hit against Medium or Heavy armour.
- Stabby: Swords. +1 melee AC and +1 to melee attack bonus.

If you’re dual wielding, the weapon in your main hand counts for the weapon bonus.

## Off-hand Options
You’ve got two hands after all!
- Dual Wield: A weapon in each hand. Roll once to hit as normal, but then roll damage for both weapons and pick the highest. Rolling doubles or a crit means take both results!
- Great Weapon: Must be wielded two handed. Apply your strength modifier to damage rolls.
- Long Weapon: Spears and such can be wielded one-handed. Wielding them two-handed allows you to attack from the second rank and get a free Opportunity Attack against foes who close into melee range.
- Shield: Shields are great. Adds +1 AC and +1 to melee attack bonus. Sacrifice it to cancel all damage from a single attack, or reduce fall damage by 10’.
- Spellbook: Many casters can cast spontaneously from Spellbooks if they have one in hand.
- Torch: In dark environs, holding a light source like a torch or lantern grants the group +1 to Initiative. Also you can see, which is good.

## Ranged Weaponry
With ranged weapons you’ve got a trade-off between armour penetration and reload speed.
- Thrown: Throw a small weapon. No armour penetration and target cannot be too far, up to 30’ of distance. Remove it from your inventory until you have a chance to pick it up.
- Slings and Bows: Shoot every round. No armour penetration. Slings deal 1d4 damage. Bows deal 1d6 damage.
- Crossbows: Light Crossbows deal 1d6 damage, ignore 2 points of armour at close range and take 1 action to reload. Heavy Crossbows deal 1d8 damage, ignore 4 points of armour at close range and take 2 actions to reload.
- Arquebus: Ignore all armour at close range and deal exploding damage but take 5 actions to reload. Guns are still rare. 1d6 melee damage.
