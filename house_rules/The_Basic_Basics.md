## The Basic Basics
- Hit Points (HP): Hit points is more like Not Getting Hit Points. You avoid any major damage until you reach 0 HP then, you start getting *serious* injuries.
- Hit Die (HD): The size of your HD is determined by class. Every level up until level 9, roll your HD and add that much to your maximum HP + your Constitution bonus. You always gain at least 1 HP per level.
- Attack Bonus: All characters get +1 to hit. This does not reliably improve unless you are a Fighter. Apply your Strength bonus to hit with melee attacks and Dexterity bonus to hit with ranged attacks.
	- When attacking a surprised enemy, +5 to hit.
- Armour Class (AC): Base AC is 9, Lower numbers are better (1st class armour > 2nd class armour). AC is modified by 
	- Subtracting your Dexterity modifier
	- Wearing armour (-2 AC per tier - Light / Medium / Heavy).
	- Using a shield (-1 AC).

### Ability Scores
- Strength: Raw power and skill at arms. Affects melee to-hit.
- Intelligence: Strength of will. Affects Saves vs Chaos. For most casters, applies to Chaos Conduit rolls when wild casting spells.
- Wisdom: Luck, strength of spirit, and heroic destiny. Affects saves except Chaos. For Clerics, affects their Healing Pool and starting Faith at the start of each day.
- Dexterity: Reflexes, agility and aim. Affects AC and ranged attack bonus.
- Constitution: Internal fortitude and sheer will to live. Affects HP per level.
- Charisma: Leadership, apparent trustworthiness, and first impressions. Affects reaction rolls and follower morale checks. This is not a Diplomacy skill - you still have to actually talk to people.

### Saving Throws
Saving throws are like last-minute saves. Their are five saves as follows. If unsure which to use, go down the list and pick the first that applies:
- paralysis: Movement-based effects.
- Poison: Death, poison, drugs, and other effects that bypass HP to kill, maim and cripple.
- Breath: Explosions, breath weapons, and other area of effect attacks.
- Devices: Magical forces from devices such as wands
- Spells: The chaotic powers of Magic, such as that used by Magic-Users.

Int/Wis: Intelligence modifier applies to Saves vs spells. Wisdom modifier applies to all other Saves

### Failed Profession
- Your Old Life: Your character starts with a Random Failed Profession. It’s up to you to work out why they don’t have that job anymore!
- Fragments of the Past: You start with a weapon and another object based on your failed career. You also assign 2 skill points based on your past. How did your Failed Profession give you this skill?

### Alignment
You don’t choose your alignment and your alignment doesn’t affect who you are or how you act or anything like that. Alignment shows the cosmic powers that you have aligned yourself to.
- If you use or are tainted by magic which causes chaos and corrupts reality, you are Chaotic.
- If you use or are tainted by miracles which preserves order and maintains reality, you are Lawful.

Everybody else (i.e. most of humanity) is Neutral.

### Experience Points
Experience points (XP) is an abstract measure of your character’s skill and power. Gain enough and you level up. You mainly get XP from loot.
- Loot: Valuable and otherwise useless treasure looted from uncivilised, abandoned or otherwise adventurous locations on a 1:1 XP-for-Silver basis split in equal shares between the party.
